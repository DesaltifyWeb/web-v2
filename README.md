# Desaltify Website

## Overview
Welcome to the Desaltify web-v2 repository! This is the main hub for the source code of Desaltify's public-facing website. Desaltify's mission is to raise awareness about the environmental impact of road salt usage, particularly in the state of Minnesota. Our aim is to foster sustainable practices that ensure the health of our ecosystems and communities. 

## The Issue
Road salt, while critical for improving road safety during icy conditions, carries a significant environmental cost. It can contaminate our freshwater systems, pose risks to aquatic wildlife, and even seep into our drinking water. Desaltify is committed to advocating for responsible road salt usage to protect our environment.

## Website Functionality
The website serves as an educational platform for individuals interested in learning more about the impact of road salt and how to contribute to a healthier environment. It features comprehensive information about the issue, solutions, Desaltify's mission and vision, and ways to get involved and support the cause.

## Tech Stack
- React.js (v18.2.0)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling and dev server

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as a standard React application, with the source code located in the `src` directory. Here's a brief overview of the key directories:

- `src/comps`: This directory contains the various React components used throughout the application.
- `src/assets`: This directory contains static files such as images or icons.
- `public`: This directory contains public assets accessible to the public like `index.html`.

## Running the Project Locally

2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd web-v2`.
